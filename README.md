```haskell
class Profunctor p where
  dimap :: (b <- a) -> (c -> d) -> (p b c -> p a d)
```

`Profunctor` is a `Functor` from `C_op x C -> Set`

"primitive category" (programming language primitive types: Boolean, Int, Float, Char, String)

In the "primitive category", arrows between two primitive types are `Function`s, which can also be denoted as an ordered pair of primitive types with function constraint enforced.

```haskell
Profunctor p => Arrow p where
  dimap :: (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> (p b c -> p a d)
                                ((b -> c) -> (a -> d))
```

```haskell
type Lens s t a b = forall p. Strong p => p a b -> p s t
```

### Yoneda Lemma

```haskell
Yo f a ~ f a

forall x. (a -> x) -> f x ~ fa
```
where
```haskell
type Reader a x = a -> x

type Yo f a = Functor f => Reader a ~> f
```

(given `a`, `Reader a x` is a `Functor` on `x`)

### Yoneda Embedding

```haskell
forall x. (a -> x) -> (b -> x) ~> (b -> a)
```
